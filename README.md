# Vending-Machine-DLD-Basic-Project
This repository contains the design and implementation of a fully functional, coin-operated Vending Machine, developed as a core project for a Digital Logic Design (DLD) course. The system is modeled using Verilog HDL and demonstrates practical application of Finite State Machine (FSM) theory in hardware design.
